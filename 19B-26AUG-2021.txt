***Q. Why Working directory clean ( linux ) messages ?

   WTC  -- Working tree is clean ( windows)

* we get the message under two conditions.

  1st - All files there are in WD/WC == files that are there in CA

    WD/WC==CA  ;; ***file content Level***

  2nd - if number of files in stage = 0

 both 1st and 2nd conditions have to be true.
